          Contrary to pigment-based coloration, blue structural coloration,
          which results from light scattering, is less common in nature.
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A few plants and animals use structural color to give themselves
            different hues by changing how light reflects off of them.
            Contrasted with pigmentation-based coloration, which occurs when an
            animal or plant acquires a particular hue as a result of pigments
            (such as paint) in its skin or leaves,
          </li>
          <li>
            An organism's physical structure, as opposed to pigments, can
            provide a sort of color called structural coloration. Particularly
            blue structural coloring is uncommon in nature since it needs
            certain structural configurations to be produced. On the other hand,
            pigment-based color is far more prevalent and is created by pigments
            that reflect some wavelengths of light while absorbing others. This
            indicates that while blue structural coloring is more challenging to
            create and sustain, it is less common in nature than pigment-based
            color.
          </li>
          <li>
            One example of structural coloring is the blue hue of some butterfly
            wings. The color blue is caused by the precise way small structures
            on the surface of the wing scatter blue light.
          </li>
          <li>
            In nature, structural coloring is more uncommon than
            pigmentation-based color because it is more difficult to create.
            While pigmentation-based coloring may be produced by simply adding
            pigments, structural coloration frequently requires the formation of
            intricate structures, such as the scales on a butterfly's wing.
          </li>
          <li>
            When a wall is painted with various colors of paint, the pigments in
            the paint are what give the paint its color. This is how
            pigmentation is conceived of. Contrarily, structural coloring is
            comparable to creating a wall out of different-shaped bricks placed
            in a precise order to produce varied hues. In this instance, the hue
            is a result of how light reacts with the bricks' structure. In
            contrast to pigmentation, structural coloring manipulates the
            physical structure to generate color rather than depending solely on
            pigments. It is an uncommon and sophisticated process.
